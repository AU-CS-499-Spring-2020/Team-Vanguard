    <string name="gen_info_text">In 1998, with the help of an anonymous donor, Ashland University purchased
        38 acres of wetland six miles south of campus on U.S. 42. In 2004, an additional 260 acres was purchased
        with the support of a grant from the Clean Ohio Conservation Fund, with a matching grant from the Richland
        County Foundation.  In 2017, seven acres were added with additional support from the Clean Ohio Conservation
        fund. This preserve has a mix of several habitats, including buttonbush swamp, swamp forest, marsh, riparian corridor,
        and upland areas. At 305 acres, the Black Fork Wetlands is the largest of Ashland University\'s five environmental preserves.\n\n

        In order to develop the potential of the Black Fork Wetlands Preserve for education of Ashland University
        students and for outreach to the community and pre-college teachers and students, a group of faculty from
        the College of Arts &amp; Sciences and College of Education began meeting in December 2004 to discuss the development
        of the Black Fork Wetlands Environmental Studies Center (BFWESC). In recognition of the educational and conservation
        value of this preserve, Ashland University approved the establishment of the BFWESC in April 2005.</string>
