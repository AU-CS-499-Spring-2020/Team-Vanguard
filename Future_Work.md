**1. Add a page for other categories of organisms like insects, plants etc.** Lists for things like this did not exist at the time 
of our project, but if this information is gathered by the time someone else works on this that would be a good and easy thing to add

**2. Add a GPS guided map** Add a page with a map of the preserve that takes adavantage of a phones location services to give the user a 
real time map of where they are in the wetlands. This could then have points of interest marked on the map that could guide the user to
interesting things in the wetlands. This was a feature we planned on implementing but by the time we were about to start work on it we were pushed off campus because of the Covid-19 pandemic, we wouldn't have had a way to go to the preserve and test if this feature worked as intened so the idea was scrapped.

**3. Add filtering and searching features** Add a feature that would allow the user to view a filtered list of organisms based on different characteristics such as size or color.

**4. Make an application like this for the other nature preserves** AU has other nature preserves other than just the wetlands, it 
would be a good idea to either add onto this application to let people view information about those as well or create entirely new
applications that are very similar for the other preserves.
